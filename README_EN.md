# MoeTalk - Your AI Companion Anywhere

**Bring your favorite characters to life!** MoeTalk is an open-source, privacy-first chat application built with Flutter that lets you converse with AI personalities. Powered by large language models (LLMs) for dialogue and diffusion models for image and voice synthesis, your conversations will be more immersive than ever.

## 📱 Usage

Use now by just clicking the [MoeTalk](https://talk.shinnpuru.online) website! MoeTalk is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can 'install' it on your favorite devices for a native-like, full-screen experience. This works across desktop and mobile platforms.

**On Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux):**
1. Open the [MoeTalk website](https://talk.shinnpuru.online) in a Chromium-based browser (like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge).
2. Look for an 'Install' icon in the address bar (it often looks like a screen with a downward arrow).
3. Click it and follow the prompts to add MoeTalk to your desktop.

**On Mobile:**
- **Android:** Open the website in Chrome, tap the three-dot menu, and select 'Install app' or 'Add to Home screen'.
- **iOS (iPhone/iPad):** Open the website in Safari, tap the 'Share' button, and scroll down to select 'Add to Home Screen'.

Before you start chatting, navigate to the **Settings** page within the app to configure your AI model APIs (LLM, Drawing, Voice).
